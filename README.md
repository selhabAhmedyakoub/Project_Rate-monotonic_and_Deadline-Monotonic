<h1>Real-Time Systems Practicum: Rate-Monotonic Scheduling and Deadline-Monotonic Scheduling</h1>
Welcome to our Real-Time Systems Practicum project! This project focuses on Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS) and Deadline-Monotonic Scheduling (DMS), two important scheduling algorithms used in real-time systems.

<h2>Overview</h2>
Real-time systems are critical in ensuring timely execution of tasks in domains such as aerospace, automotive, and industrial automation. The objective of this practicum is to provide a comprehensive understanding of RMS and DMS and their role in meeting strict timing requirements.

<h3>Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)</h3>
RMS assigns priorities to tasks based on their relative periods. Tasks with shorter periods are given higher priorities, ensuring that tasks with stricter timing requirements are executed first. This algorithm is particularly effective for periodic tasks in real-time systems.

<h3>Deadline-Monotonic Scheduling (DMS)</h3>
DMS assigns priorities to tasks based on their relative deadlines. Tasks with earlier deadlines are assigned higher priorities, ensuring that tasks with impending deadlines are executed with priority. DMS is beneficial for tasks with varied deadlines and finds wide application in real-time systems.

<h2>Project Details</h2>
In this project, we have developed an interactive interface to demonstrate the functionality of RMS and DMS scheduling algorithms. The interface allows users to input task parameters such as arrival time, execution time, period, and deadline. Using these inputs, the system schedules tasks and allocates resources based on the chosen algorithm.

<h2>YouTube Video</h2>
To provide a visual demonstration of our project, we have created a YouTube video that showcases the interface and its functionalities. The video illustrates how the interface can be used to simulate the scheduling process, visualize task execution, and analyze the resulting schedule.
